Hi there. 👋 I'm a PhD student at [ENSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_de_Lyon) and [Foxstream](https://www.foxstream.us.com/), working on self-supervised learning for imaging inverse problems including image super-resolution and deblurring, and most specifically focused on combining equivariant imaging and scale-invariance. Feel free to contact me if you have any question.
