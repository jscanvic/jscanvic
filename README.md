Hi there. 👋 I am a postgraduate research student at the University of Edinburgh, working on self-supervised learning for imaging inverse problems including image super-resolution and deblurring, and most specifically focused on combining equivariant imaging and scale-invariance. Feel free to contact me if you have any question.
